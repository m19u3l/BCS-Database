# 🚀 QUICK TEST GUIDE - Get It Working in 5 Minutes

## Step 1: Replace Files (3 files total)

### File 1: db.js (Root directory)
**Location:** `Venicwe-Bcs-ig/db.js`
- **Replace** your current db.js with: **"db.js - COMPLETE WORKING VERSION"** artifact
- This combines your original invoice system + new insurance features

### File 2: routes/remediation-dryout.js
**Location:** `Venicwe-Bcs-ig/routes/remediation-dryout.js`
- **Replace** the placeholder with: **"routes/remediation-dryout.js - Complete"** artifact

### File 3: routes/remediation-reconstruction.js
**Location:** `Venicwe-Bcs-ig/routes/remediation-reconstruction.js`
- **Replace** the placeholder with: **"routes/remediation-reconstruction.js - Complete"** artifact

## Step 2: Fresh Start

```bash
# Delete old database
rm invoice.db

# Start server
npm run dev
```

**You should see:**
```
✅ Database initialized successfully
✅ Sample data inserted
✅ Server running on port 3000
```

## Step 3: Test Both Systems Work

### TEST ORIGINAL INVOICE SYSTEM:

```bash
# Get clients
curl http://localhost:3000/api/clients

# Get services
curl http://localhost:3000/api/services

# Get dashboard stats
curl http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard/stats
```

### TEST NEW INSURANCE SYSTEM:

```bash
# Create a water damage dryout project
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/remediation/dryout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "work_order_id": 1,
    "project_number": "DRY-2025-001",
    "loss_type": "Water",
    "loss_category": "Category 2",
    "insurance_carrier": "State Farm",
    "claim_number": "SF-123456"
  }'

# Get all dryout projects
curl http://localhost:3000/api/remediation/dryout

# Create a reconstruction project
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/remediation/reconstruction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "work_order_id": 1,
    "project_name": "Kitchen Water Damage Reconstruction",
    "reconstruction_type": "Water",
    "insurance_carrier": "State Farm",
    "claim_number": "SF-123456"
  }'

# Get all reconstruction projects
curl http://localhost:3000/api/remediation/reconstruction
```

## Step 4: Test Advanced Features

### Add Moisture Reading (IICRC Compliance):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/remediation/dryout/1/moisture-reading \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "room": "Living Room",
    "material_type": "Drywall",
    "location_description": "North wall, 3ft from corner",
    "moisture_percentage": 18.5,
    "target_moisture": 12.0,
    "technician": "Mike Johnson"
  }'
```

### Add Equipment Deployment:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/remediation/dryout/1/equipment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "equipment_type": "Dehumidifier",
    "equipment_model": "Phoenix LGR 2800i",
    "serial_number": "PHX-2800-1234",
    "quantity": 2,
    "location": "Living Room",
    "rental_rate_per_day": 85.00
  }'
```

### Add Daily Log:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/remediation/dryout/1/daily-log \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "technician_name": "Mike Johnson",
    "work_performed": "Placed 3 air movers and 2 dehumidifiers",
    "hours_worked": 6.5,
    "notes": "Initial setup complete"
  }'
```

### Generate Xactimate Estimate:
```bash
# For dryout project
curl http://localhost:3000/api/remediation/dryout/1/xactimate-format

# For reconstruction project  
curl http://localhost:3000/api/remediation/reconstruction/1/xactimate-estimate
```
